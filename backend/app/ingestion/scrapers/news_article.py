"""Fetching the body of a news article, so a news finding rests on more than a headline.

News is Loom's largest corpus and its least useful. Finnhub returns a headline
and a one-line summary, and until now that was all Loom stored: a median of 247
characters per item against 324,000 for a 10-K. Three consequences followed, and
they are all the same problem.

Documents yield almost nothing: 0.02 findings each, against 0.68 for a 10-K. A
finding cannot rest on a headline, so the model correctly declines most of them.

Quotes attributed to news cannot be checked, because Loom never held the text
they came from. The faithfulness harness found exactly one quote that appears
nowhere in Loom's own data, and it was a news-sourced `emerging_pattern`.

And Loom's claim to read several kinds of source is weaker than it looks when
one of them is a headline feed.

**The conduct here matters more than the parsing.** Two rules, and the second is
easy to get wrong:

*robots.txt is checked against the publisher, not the aggregator.* The stored URL
is a Finnhub redirector, so checking robots on `finnhub.io` would ask the wrong
site's permission for every article Loom reads. The redirect is resolved first
and the publisher's own rules decide.

*A body that cannot be had is not approximated.* A blocked or paywalled article
keeps its headline-and-summary stub and records why, so the evidence API can say
truthfully what Loom holds for that document. Returning a nav-bar scrape or a
paywall teaser as an article body would put text in front of a model that no
journalist wrote.
