"""Shared scraper infrastructure: robots.txt, rate limiting, honest identity.

Every scraper in the project goes through this class. The three rules it
enforces are not decoration, they are the difference between a research tool
and a nuisance:

1. **robots.txt is obeyed, not consulted.** `can_fetch` is checked before every
   request and a disallowed URL is skipped. The fetch returns None; the caller
   logs and moves on. There is no override flag, deliberately, an override that
   exists is an override that eventually gets used.
2. **One request per domain at a time, spaced.** Rate limiting is keyed by
   domain rather than by scraper, so two scrapers pointed at the same host
   still cooperate. It is delegated to `ingestion/rate_limit.py` so that
   scrapers and the SEC adapters share one view of how busy this process is
   being; a per-scraper limiter would have each source politely pacing itself
   while the process as a whole was not.
3. **The User-Agent identifies this tool honestly.** It never impersonates a
   browser. If a site wants to block Loom it must be able to, spoofing Chrome
   to evade a block is exactly the behaviour robots.txt exists to prevent.

A failure inside one scraper is contained here (`fetch_html` returns None
rather than raising) so a broken selector or a 503 on one source can never
take down an ingestion run for the others.
