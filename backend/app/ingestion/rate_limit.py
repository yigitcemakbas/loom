"""One process-wide rate limit per host, shared by every adapter.

Ingestion used to be a single sequential loop, so "be polite to SEC" could be
expressed as `time.sleep(0.2)` after each request and that was genuinely
enough. Two things break the moment tickers are fetched concurrently.

The first is correctness. A sleep after a request paces one thread. Four
threads each sleeping 0.2s between their own requests produce twenty requests
a second in aggregate, not five, and SEC answers sustained abuse with a
block that lasts far longer than the run. Rate limiting has to be a property
of the process, not of a call site.

The second is that the old pattern also throttled the wrong thing. Sleeping
*after* a response means the interval is added to the request's own latency,
so a 300ms fetch plus a 200ms sleep gives two requests a second when five were
allowed. A limiter reserves the next slot and waits only for as long as that
slot is actually in the future, which is both correct under concurrency and
faster in the ordinary case.

Hosts are keyed by netloc because that is the unit the other side rate limits
on. sec.gov and data.sec.gov are deliberately collapsed onto one bucket: they
are one operator with one fair-access policy, and three adapters (filings,
Form 4, ticker lookup) hit them from different code paths with no idea the
others exist.
